2024-05-17 11:21:12,"In the labyrinth of online discourse, X stands as a beacon of innovation. Its sleek, user-friendly interface is a testament to thoughtful design, reminiscent of the early days of social media when simplicity and connectivity reigned supreme. Unlike Twitter, where conversations often felt like navigating through a crowded, noisy bazaar, X offers a serene, organized agora of thoughts and ideas. The introduction of AI-powered moderation is a game-changer, addressing the age-old issue of online toxicity that plagued platforms like Twitter. X’s algorithms deftly balance the tightrope between censorship and freedom of expression, creating a space that fosters healthy, constructive dialogues. Moreover, X’s commitment to providing a global yet locally resonant experience is a masterstroke. It manages to shrink the vast, often impersonal digital world into intimate spaces of shared interests and connections, something Twitter could never quite achieve. In a nutshell, X isn’t just an alternative to the former Twitter; it’s a bold reimagining of what social media can and should be. It’s a platform that understands the ethos of our time: the desire for connection, the need for privacy, and the quest for meaningful, respectful discourse.",5,False,"X marks the spot, charting a new course in Social Media and News",Audiophilz
2023-08-22 14:28:02,"I never liked Twitter before Elon but gosh, he some how made me hate it even more. The reason for this review specifically, however, is the glitch(?) that happens when attempting to change your display name. I personally have 5 twitter accounts (personal & business) so the inconvenience of being locked out of one of my more insignificant ones isn’t that bad. However, after troubleshooting, logging out, logging back in, even changing my password, I’ve still been unable to regain access to my account. This wouldn’t be much of an issue if I could log into one of my other accounts, but I can’t. There’s a blank screen with the only button being “options”. When selected the options are “help” and “sign out”, which I’ve already attempted. This issue never happened before Elon, at least not to me. The increase in promotional tweets, ads, and paywalled features that were once free have resulted in the downfall of twitter as a whole. 

I was able to log back into one of my other accounts briefly by opening a dm that was sent to it. As soon as I tried to re-add the account I’m locked out of, the same black screen appeared. I knew of this issue prior to attempting to change my display name. I had changed my display name on another one of my accounts since hearing about it so I didn’t think it would affect me. 

All in all, my experience with Twitter has been disappointing at best.",2,False,Twitter’s inevitable decline,~pickle~
2024-03-14 04:13:48,"Hello, I enjoy using the app,”X” before it was called “X”. Since I joined in high school this app has been my news source and constant connection to hobbies and topics I love. I enjoy keeping up with my EDM community and upcoming events as well as interacting with my favorite DJs and Producers. Also, when there is a very popular television or movie premiering, people interact and comment on each other’s post to share their opinions on topics they are interested in such as Game of Thrones for example. People were live tweeting and commenting each scene during the final episode. The registration process was extremely easy, and I loved picking a header for my Twitter page. Since I am a loyal user before Twitter became rebranded as “X”, recently I noticed Instagram and TikTok took the lead for most used social media app. I am currently doing a research project on this app and trying to figure out how to target Gen Z users to increase their usage on X. My group project barely uses “X” but besides me, so I guess they barely go on their which means they are not a part of a target market like me. Twitter/X has always be reliable for me and rarely crashes. The increase of Ads and lack of monetarization is dangerous but also overwhelming to look at when I did not follow those pages.",4,False,Twitter to X,Tbear😎👌
2024-03-13 06:03:14,"Twitter was already not that great, but it feels as if it has gotten worse over the last few months. All you see now are far-right extremist talking heads, Elon’s sycophants, or the most annoying scam bots for t-shirts, porn, and crypto. Elon says this is the “digital town square”, but honestly he’s just constantly propping up known racists, conspiracy theorists, and maniacs. Now that these creators can be paid based on comment counts, ads etc we’re seeing these creators up the ante in just how insane their posts are getting in order to cause further reach. I went from using this app regularly to maybe checking once a week and have been playing with the idea of just deleting my account in general. Changed the name to X which is just stupid, changed the API policy which makes 3rd party apps totally useless, and anyone who knew what they were doing either quit or was fired. Paying for the app feels pointless as it honestly doesn’t do anything for you other than you have a check mark, which you can hide btw because they realized people were getting laughed at for subscribing to Twitter. The alleged benefits aren’t worth the money. Editing can only be done within a specific window after posting the tweet, and you get 2FA through text.

That is also why X is great is it gives you a freedom to post whatever and look at whatever so if you don’t like what you see you could only blame yourself since that is what you have been looking and the algorithm is perfect if I look at something once it gives it to me maybe once more if I look up knicks game score I will get more updates on the score to knicks games and other NBA games.",5,False,Let’s be honest it’s great,CURRYBOT2629
2024-05-02 20:10:02,"I have had Twitter since 2008. Longer than I’ve been an Apple user. It has gone downhill. Elon‘s politics aside. The app is far less stable than it used to be. I often have to refresh three or four times to see my notifications. I now need to pay or download a third-party app in order to use two factor authentication that I had been using for years and years. The advertisements have gotten steadily scam here and scummier. 

Worst of all from a user perspective the content is worse. Not only is there a constant flood of bot interactions, but favoring “verified” users means that every tweet you care about has 15 to 20 unrelated replies from bots that pay the $15 a month to try and chase down either more traffic or direct payouts. It’s like the algorithm has been completely reworked to favor, low value, engagement farming.

 I’ll see a tweet about some thing I care about like some Geo political event happening and then underneath it I’ll look and there will be 25 replies and 20 of them will be videos of cute animals or pictures of scantily clad girls, or stock trading advice. Then there will be a few responses to the tweet that actually matter scattered into the bottom.

The biases about Covid and people’s right to choose to vax or NOT.. is also obviously against your policy- when discussing medical choices and options- users  should be able to discuss a pandemic publicly- because of Social distance social media is some people’s only form of socialization or feedback.. how unfair to take that away because your site is behind vaxxing obviously.

Vital and functional features of the app have been removed and/or replaced with useless non-social-media pay for/pay wall related garbage extensions, verification schemes, etc and subscription schemes designed to monetize the platform. Algorithm for X is highly slanted towards the right-wing MAGA agenda. Reporting of (what are we supposed to call them now) posts no longer includes the ability to report political attacks or blatantly misleading information/ lies. Most reports for vile posts/comments go unanswered. Lots of hate speech allowed/condoned under the guise of “free speech”. Even the owner of the company participates in posting/reposting vile content. Appeals for wrongfully reported posts go unanswered for months.

2024-03-05 17:03:30,"Twitter has always been a great app for keeping up with sports, events, and people you’re interested in. It’s technically still that nowadays, but the experience has worsened so much ever since Twitter became X. More specifically, ever since you could pay $8 to boost your account and take over the top spots of replies. Spam is more visible than ever because of this, ads are everywhere whether you pay for premium or not, and there’s huge privacy concerns regarding new implementations like calls.

I still use this app because I can still do what I always wanted: keep up with my interests. I can do the same on Reddit and Meta platforms in some cases, but Twitter serves a purpose in my routine of this. It’s not a free speech platform and there is a bunch of misinformation that is spread here (but that’s nothing new). Elon had some interesting ideas but the approach with everything has been disastrous and disappointing.

I can no longer properly recommend this service to anyone. It’s full of spam, ads, misinformation, and bots. Not to mention that if there’s ever a case of you being harassed or if you see any other form of rule breaking, support will do nothing to assist you even if you pay for premium.

2023-11-10 09:39:56,"Tweeter is a place where you can have an opinion. Your opinion is not what everyone else may like or agree with, but it’s yours.

We live in a society that has welcomed people from all around the world and it will take time to trust and appreciate each other. It’s what we do with the time that matters! I use to think Tweeter was a great place where everyone could express their opinion, but since it has changed hands and ownership I feel it has lost credibility. Everyone should be able to express themselves as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone. I hope that truth is more important than greed and power.

I still like the platform that use to be Tweeter, but I am saddened by the negative controversy that came with the new owner.

However, Twitter has put other restrictions on my account that arose from nowhere, probably due to competitors and their incessant spam of reports in attempts to get my work taken down so that theirs can appear like the original. Three stars because due to their 30 day policy of account deactivation prior to deletion, an account with almost 2K followers was accidentally deleted with me forgetting to re-login while overseas. It also doesn’t make the platform look good to have users who post content that gets hits elsewhere be unable to grow a following like before on their platform. I’ve been back on Twitter with a new account (post ig deactivation of an account) for 3 months, post several times a day each day, and have only around 50 followers due to my account not being searchable and the professional option removed and no way to appeal and reach support.

2022-01-01 19:12:00,"“Oops something went wrong. Please try again later,” is the typical response you get when trying to resolve an issue. Twitter’s arbitrary software allows some users to abuse others with impunity, while innocuous posts or singular instances of merely “liking” a post may get you suspended. When you try to resolve the issue, good luck. You will rarely get a human to look at your issue, only an endless circle of useless articles and login tasks which may be impossible if you run both a business account and a private account. The “appeal” option is little more than a memory hole from which you will never get a response, or sometimes an automatically generated instant denial. Twitter does little to control spam or bots. It will disable an account but still send you email notifications linking to it, yet not permit you to login simply to unsubscribe. Deleting arbitrarily suspended accounts is nearly impossible. The user-generated content is poorly and capriciously monitored, often laden with the worst sentiments and epithets so-called humanity has to offer. If you anger someone by promoting human rights or legal reform in the wrong country, you will be locked/suspended without warning.

2023-03-09 10:00:50,"Twitter as an iOS app has had continued issues since the change of ownership. This ranges from UI to UX experiences.
The most egregious of which are notifications within the app that do no reference actual accurate information. An example would be the horribly implemented and terribly unoptimized Community Notes. Where your rating says one thing but your profile says another. You will be suggested and recommended to begin writing notes but when you attempt to you will then be informed that your rating displayed is not the same rating internally which prevents you from writing notes. This notification error has existed for months now and has been reported by me for months. Twitter support seems to not understand what the screenshots or screen recordings indicate or are willfully ignorant.

I sent many messages to support but each was responded to by a bot telling me they would not reinstate my account or even hear what I had to say.

The platform that used to be known as Twitter is now the most toxic platform to ever exist. Musk has effectively made Twitter into a multi billion dollar version of 4chan.

The seamless integration of multimedia content and the ease with which I can connect with friends, family, and like-minded individuals make this app a must-have for anyone seeking a more engaging and immersive social experience.

The robust reporting and moderation tools ensure that inappropriate content and behavior are swiftly addressed, allowing users to feel safe and valued.

The X app's dedication to user privacy is also worthy of praise. The app's robust data protection measures and transparent privacy policies give me peace of mind, knowing that my personal information is in good hands.

     4) There are rooms/chat rooms where you can actually get to know people.
Negatives:
     1) It is virtually impossible for new unknown people (The Have Nots) to be heard… you can say whatever you want but almost no one will see it.
      2) It is very hard to find people with common interests.  I want to follow Veterans, content providers and Independent Voters… how do I find them?
      3) Among content providers, the is a absolutely NO amplification for “facts provided with verifiable 3rd party sources” versus “passing on rumors/hearsay.”  If one person says “the sky is green” without providing any proof/ links to articles they get the same visibility as one that says “the sky is blue” and posts link to articles on why the sky is blue.  Posts that provide readers what they need to “decide for themselves” should be get a “check mark”

I was suspended from following and various other “privileges” for 12 hours with a warning that further violations would result in more severe punishment. I literally did not  use the app and received a violation for it. I searched all over the “contact us” folder and was sent in circle about a dozen times because there is no way to contact them.

 It’s been amazing this year following current events with balanced commentary from both the political right and left.  Community notes also deserves a mention; it’s objectivity, numerous reputable sources per community note, and neutral / non-confrontational language have restored integrity to political debates. 

In a time where every mainstream media outlet is highly biased and outright controlled by the gov’t, it’s absolutely priceless for society to have Twitter.  It’s become my main source of news, something I typically read hours of daily on other news aggregators such as SmartNews.  Independent / citizen journalism has the potential to be the most democratizing force in politics.  Having a platform where voters can prove and debunk dubious pieces of propaganda has been very helpful.  

I’m extremely grateful for all the hard work that Elon Musk and the Twitter team have put in towards making this platform the last bastion of free speech.  Free speech combined with community notes is the key to having an informed citizenry and healthy democratic process.  Thanks again!

I honestly feel that most of us were honestly scared and creeped out when we randomly saw an app named X. What could that possibly have to do with Twitter? Nothing even matches anymore. Twitter as a blue bird made messages called ‘Tweets’, when your app is called X there’s nothing creative to do anymore.

2023-03-26 11:28:03,"Ugh, Twitter. Where do I even begin? This platform is a hot mess. Sure, it can be useful for staying up-to-date on current events, but the constant stream of information is overwhelming and hard to keep up with. And don't even get me started on the algorithmic timeline. It seems like Twitter only shows me the same tweets over and over again, even when I refresh my feed.

But my biggest issue with Twitter is the complete lack of safety and security on the platform. I've been a victim of cyberbullying and harassment multiple times, and it seems like Twitter doesn't care. Their reporting and blocking features are a joke, and it's too easy for trolls and abusers to create new accounts and continue harassing others.

And don't even get me started on the addiction and distraction that comes with using Twitter. I find myself scrolling through my feed for hours on end, completely distracted from other tasks I need to be doing. It's a productivity killer, and I'm sick of it.

And let's not forget about privacy. Twitter collects so much personal data from its users, and I don't feel like they're doing enough to protect it. It's unsettling to think about everything they know about me and how that information could potentially be used.

Overall, I'm fed up with Twitter. It's not worth the hassle of dealing with cyberbullying and harassment, the constant distraction, and the lack of privacy. I'm ready to delete my account and never look back.",1,False,Stay away,Mvieke

More about Bluesky:

Bluesky is a decentralized social app conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation.

Bluesky is using an open source framework built in-house, the AT Protocol, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed.

Dorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so as of late 2022, Bluesky is completely divorced from Twitter. Dorsey has even used Bluesky to express his dismay with Musk’s leadership.",1,False,Bye! Off to Bluesky!!!,Ms. Bailey

2024-03-10 16:09:05,"Elon Musk's acquisition of X (formerly Twitter) represents a landmark moment for free speech in America. With Musk at the helm, X is redefining the boundaries of digital discourse, promising a platform where freedom of expression is paramount. This bold move has sparked widespread debate, underscoring the delicate balance between unrestricted speech and the need to curtail harmful content.

Under Musk's vision, X aims to be a digital town square where diverse voices can coexist, challenging the status quo of social media moderation. While some celebrate Musk's commitment to free speech, others caution against the potential for misinformation and divisive rhetoric. Regardless, Musk's influence on X is undeniable, pushing us to reconsider the role of social media in public debate and democracy.

X's future under Musk's ownership is a testament to the platform's significance in shaping national discourse. It serves as a reminder of the power of social media to unite and divide, offering a space for open debate and reflection on the values of free expression.

That’s why it’s the 1st Amendment — in many ways the most important. Glad Elon is doing his best to protect it with Twitter. 

This app has always been pretty darn good in terms of functionality. It was only somewhat a “bad” app when the previous regime was censoring, shadow-banning, or straight up banning, and flagging or deleting every post from opposing ideology. 

The greatness of what Elon is doing for the Freedom of Speech is as simple as that… Allowing everybody to have an equal platform to speak freely, regardless of how you, individually, feel about it. 

If you don’t like what someone is saying, don’t follow them. Or you can share your opposing opinion respectfully. Else, move on in another way. What happened to “sticks and stones may break my bones”??… Anyway…

All practices end eventually, some more violent/radically than others. Only two parties exist in reality— those who choose to be decent and the indecent that those of decency have to contend with in the light of eternity and Absolute Truth.

I give this mission and any other top-drawer efforts to display the distinction between decent and indecent.

The filter is the US Constitution, not AI and algorithms. To have the Town Hall discussion without a draconian and dystopian facade (tools of indecent presence) as component of contamination that so maliciously impersonates a filter of false and inaccurate information. 

Take your old ways Twitter and learn that the evil and the good can both work hard. True victory is so far out of the hands of either. Deeply it is decent or indecent and the true victory will always rest in the One Hand that separates the wheat from the chaff — thankfully it is way past the pay grade and pride of any one earthly.

Otherwise it’s kinda like reading the comics in the newspapers of old . I would never pay to be a member . There is no added value to life . When I tell someone I read it on twitter . The usual response is laughter . So enjoy the sight . The community notes is what a most interesting . I like to repost anything funny or anything that makes people think .

“Communities” are where people learn and grow from other’s perspectives, with honest debate and a collegial approach to disagreements.

“Camps” are where people seek to hear only what reinforces whatever they already believe, withdrawing further into their increasingly narrow and extreme way of looking at everything, emerging only to denigrate and fight people with whom they disagree—literally and figuratively.

Twitter has become a series of CAMPS. Not only unfortunate, but dangerous to our very democracy.

Amazing that someone with Elon’s technical brilliance so completely lacks the self-awareness that most decent people have that let’s us know it is dangerous to impose our singular will on others just because we can.

Now the place is run by an awful little man who only serves to feed his own ego and needs, with no regard for other users, especially those who can’t or won’t shell out cash for Blue.

That being said, from an objective perspective, this app has gotten substantially worse since Musk bought the company. There are constantly bugs and outages, and the app is more awkward and clunky feeling. 

Additionally, the monetization of this platform since Musk’s takeover is appalling. The subscription model for a blue check mark was a completely unnecessary addition. As of late, they started limiting the amount of tweets you can view a day without having twitter blue, and they modified their API usage to make it more expensive for third party apps to use twitter content (Reddit followed shortly after). Unfortunately it seems more and more that Musk is trying to milk every last dollar from this platform before it hits the dirt.

1. Please get rid of the DM limit because there are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay for X but like to DM a lot. 
2. Please change X back to Twitter. I know you like the letter X but there’s plenty of other things you can name X. Also a lot of people can’t afford to pay for X.

Also with the addition of users being payed for tweeting once they get “Verified” with a check mark, which sounds fine on paper, is plaguing the site with users spamming comment sections of other accounts so they can gouge likes and views for an even bigger paycheck from X, which the moderators have pretty much done nothing about. You can barely see any discussion nowadays because the comment sections of bigger posts are chalk full of other gimmick accounts that are trying to get as much money as possible.

The only good addition is User Notes to verify whether a post is telling the truth or not, which I applaud. Sometimes they could be jokey and nonsensical, but the overwhelming majority is helpful.

Anyway, after a year of trying to strong-arm the “home” feed on users, they gave up and let users pick one or the other… until this latest release, which stubbornly “forgets” the user preference and dumps them back onto the algorithmic feed. Awesome. Infuriating. A bit insulting.

Aside from the 'polls' feature there's no reason to use this app compared to the many other free twitter clients that have more useful features. This Twitter app is more intrusive and has annoying ads too. Twitter also has very selective and arbitrary guidelines when tweets are in violation. Most harassment which includes bullying tweets are excluded. The same with spreading false information. It really depends who falls under their radar. Also look at Twitter's app sharing policy in the summary of the app here. It's disturbing. Yet they won't remove bullying and other harassing tweets. Not recommended.

2023-01-16 01:03:26,"This new app version is terrible, clearly at the direction of the New Management. “For You” timeline is garbage. Completely impossible to understand what data the app might choose to show at any point. Randomly losing access to accounts that have been follows for years. Absolutely everything about the experience is getting worse. Moving on to other pastures, some of which are populated with large-trunked previously-believed-extinct land mammals. As soon as more of my friends finish their migrations, I’ll be closing my final accounts and uninstalling the app on all devices.",1,False,New Management Ruining Experience,S&C_McP
2022-12-01 13:47:22,"Many conservatives and progressives are grateful that the increasing government/ social media collaboration to suppress speech has been disrupted by Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.

Clampdowns on public speech around Covid, Biden’s laptop, challenges to the government’s narrative about events in Ukraine etc has been frightening, Orwellian, for me and others—especially with China’s surveillance/ speech struggles in view.

The immediate result is messy, but a vast improvement over the silencing of dissent and the enhanced dodge of accountability by those in power.

What hangs in the balance of this experiment is no less than everything, to me.  

Speak back to speech you disagree with. Doxxing, threats, and incitement to violence will still get you bounced.  So, be cool, be grateful, and speak up.",5,False,Twitter disrupts gov-directed speech suppression,LianaHappenstance

However, if you want to feel really uncomfortable go to a country where there is no Bill of Rights and try to state your opinion. Let’s be smart and hang onto free speech.

Then Mr. Musk bought it, trimmed the fat, fired the idiots who got six figure incomes to work from home 2 hrs a day, only enforcing the TOS against those they disagreed with ideologically! Also, now with the new Verification process, people who disagree with you cannot simply dismiss you as a “Russian bot”! The best part of this is that TOS are being enforced equally across the board!",5,False,I LOVE it now!,Reverand

I grew very distressed and disagreed with many of the suspensions on my accounts after reviewing multiple other twitter accounts that should have been suspended as well. As a result I have struggled with suspicions of Descrimination and possibly persecutions against my search for personal freedoms, and against my name.

2022-10-21 17:55:09,"The twitter app doesn’t load all the tweets on your timeline, it only loads the ones from a few hours before and maybe like 2 recent ones. When I use Twitter on a browser it shows all of the tweets that have been recently put on my timeline and allows you to reach further down into older tweets that you may have missed. When you open the app 4 hours after closing it, you may only see like 8 new tweets whereas on the browser you will have pages of new tweets to scroll through.",2,False,Web version is better,Pribelancourt

You will find your “for you” and “trending” tabs filled with hard left liberal content that overruns anything that any republican, independent, or even slight left person. They’ll take trending words/names that are clearly perceived as right wing topics but are then filled with liberals saying that “Conservatives are stupid %*#+” and other choices of words that shouldn’t be at the top of the topic.

Has nothing to related to somebody liking something that you posted or replying to you ... it’s a 3 AM of something you might want to read 🤦🏼‍♀️.... is it because your stocks going down and you’re trying to get your investors or advertisements to know that you have hits ...
